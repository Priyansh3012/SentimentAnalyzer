# Movie Sentiment Analysis using NLP
# NLP Project [PYTHON | PANDAS | NUMPY | Scikit-Learn | NLTK | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Plotly | Streamlit]

Movie Sentiment Analysisis a website that uses Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing as its backbone to predict whether the comment or review entered for the movie, have a Positive Sentiment or a Negative Sentiment.

The flow of the project is as follows :- 

<1> Data Preprocessing (Data Cleaning) 
<2> EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) 
<3> Feature Engineering (Lemmatization, CountVectorization, TfidfVectorizer, Unigrams, Bigrams, Trigrams, 4-grams . At the end combination of unigrams + bigrams +     + Trigrams used.)
<4> Model Evaluation (Decision Tree Classifier , Random Forest Classifier , Logistic Regression (Classifier). Out of these 3 Logistic Regression gave best results.  )
<5> Hyperparameter Tuning ( using GridSearchCV)
<6> Model Selection (Logistic Regression)

In the frontend I have used Streamlit to create Sentiment Analyzer website.

NOTE : Plotly graphs and charts may not be rendered in the notebook.
